    <h2>The Creation of FBI's B.A.U. Team</h2>
    <p>When it comes to crime, it isn't the crime done that fascinates me; it's the reason. The mind is something that, to this day, no matter how much research is done, remains the most unknown and uncertain thing we carry.
      There isn't a single brain that is the same. Our everyday choices and the things we do, or the things that happen to us affect it. For example, Trauma. A child can grow up in an unhealthy home with parents who are distant. When they grow up they will be codependent on a partner or a friend who resembles the only happy times the distant parents gave to said child. That can turn for good, or in the case I'm taking it, Bad. When and If that happens, a stressor is a start to the first signs. Say, that a friend or partner they attached to leaves or passes away, their brain chemistry changes, and now they want a replacement. They will go to drastic measures to find the perfect candidate that checks off their list. Someone who reminds them of happy times so they feel stable again. But there's a catch, they're not stable anymore. They will resort to all sorts of things. Kidnapping, stalking, cyberstalking, to something even bigger, such as murder or torture.
      It's all a connection. The story, Stresser, Release, Downspiral, and their inevitable end.</p>
  <p>In 1970, there was a rise in both Sexual abuse and Homicide in the USA. In 1972, Robert Ressler, an Army Veteran dealt with and solved cases involving robberies, homicides, and arson, and John Douglas, An FBI hostage negotiator, founded a team that made it their goal to study incarcerated criminals to gain future insight on cases. At the time, studying the behavior of criminals was rare, and law enforcement mainly used hard evidence to help progress in cases. Even "Serial Killer" wasn't used until Ressler fabricated the phrase to describe patterns of murders in the same time frame and similarity.
      Through interviews with incarcerated criminals, they were successful in creating a list containing three types of perpetrators.
      <ul>
          <li><b>Organized Offenders</b>: A type of killer who is smart, cunning with knowledge on disposing evidence, they are stable enough to know how to dodge mistakes.</li>
          <li><b>Disorganized Offenders</b>: These types are killers who use more emotion-based crimes. Their lower intelligence makes them dispose of less evidence or none at all.</li>
          <li><b>Mixed Offenders</b>: Offenders who exhibit both Organized and Disorganized characteristics.</li>
      </ul>
  <p>Another tactic used is called The Macdonald Triad, which consists of another three items that are looked for in their childhood youth.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Enuresis (Bed-wetting)</b></li>
          <li><b>Pyromania (Fire Setting)</b></li>
          <li><b>Animal Cruelty</b></li>
      </ul>
         <p> Though it has been around since 1963, they have not subsequently supported said theory, and is better used to help uncover children who have been raised in a poor or dysfunctional home with Parental Cruelty (e.g. Abuse or Neglect).
      Tieing those together is one thing to help, but a big advance to help profile criminals in a crime scene is to look past the hard evidence and use that to see if they leave behind a signature, like a specific way of harming, which can reveal their type of victim or disturbance of there mind, revealing their personality. This grueling work led them, Alongside the help of Ann Burgess, A Psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialist who assessed and treated victims of Trauma and Abuse, to interview 36 criminals, Including the "Co-Ed Killer" Ed Kemper, "The BTK Killer" Dennis Rader, and "The Killer Clown" John Wayne Gacy.
      Since they began, The BAU has branched. Starting into Terrorism, Street gangs and Mobs, Violent Extremism, Hostage Negotiations, and Violence in Prisons.
      This Job isn't for the weak, it takes immense emotions and guts to handle what they deal with. I Honor the time they put in and sacrifice, knowing that this grueling part of the world will forever stay as long as humans walk the earth.</p>
